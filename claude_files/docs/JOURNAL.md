# TaxSnap — Decisions Journal

Append-only log of decisions made during the build, especially where team members
disagreed. CLAUDE.md references this file as the home for decisions and deferred ideas.

## 2026-06-01 — Day 1 / EPIC-1 Foundation kickoff

### DEC-001 — Multi-tenant isolation: app-layer filtering + RLS default-deny backstop
- **Context:** SPEC routes all server-side DB access through the Supabase service-role
  client and relies on `organization_id` filters on every query (Raj). Jordan wants
  Row Level Security so a single app bug can't leak data across tenants.
- **Tension:** We use custom phone-OTP auth, NOT Supabase Auth. `auth.uid()` is not
  available to Postgres RLS policies without building a custom-JWT signing layer, which
  is out of scope for Day 1.
- **Decision:** Enable RLS on every table with a **default-deny** policy. The `anon`
  key can read/write nothing; only the `service_role` key (server-only) bypasses RLS.
  In application code, ALL queries go through a mandatory `orgScoped()` helper that
  injects `organization_id`. 
- **Rationale:** Jordan gets a hard backstop against accidental public exposure (the
  most likely real-world leak path) without us building custom-JWT RLS on Day 1. Raj
  keeps the simple, fast server data path. 
- **Owners:** Raj (data path) + Jordan (policy). 
- **Deferred to V2:** Custom-JWT RLS so policies can enforce per-org isolation even if
  the service role is misused. Tracked here, not lost.

### DEC-002 — Next.js app lives at repo root, not in a `taxsnap-mvp/` subdirectory
- **Context:** `tickets/01-foundation.md` TSNAP-002 literally says
  `npx create-next-app@latest taxsnap-mvp`.
- **Decision:** Scaffold the app at the **repo root**. Planning docs stay in
  `claude_files/`.
- **Rationale:** Avoids a monorepo "root directory" setting on Vercel; one deploy
  target, zero extra config. The literal subdir name in the ticket was illustrative.

### DEC-003 — Phone numbers stored encrypted-at-rest (Supabase), never app-hashed
- **Context:** Jordan wants phone numbers hashed/encrypted. Raj needs plaintext: the
  inbound SMS webhook looks users up by `From`, and outbound SMS needs the real number.
- **Decision:** Store plaintext, rely on Supabase managed at-rest disk encryption. Do
  NOT app-hash the column. Add a `maskPhone()` logging helper (shows only last 4) and
  forbid logging full numbers anywhere.
- **Rationale:** A one-way hash breaks lookup-by-number and outbound send — it would
  break the core product. At-rest encryption + log masking covers the realistic
  exposure (leaked logs / casual DB browsing).

### DEC-004 — `personal` category retained with deduction_percentage = 0
- **Context:** The `personal` (§262) row in `substantiation_rules` is "general" level but
  not deductible. Minor modeling oddity flagged during seed review.
- **Decision:** Keep as specced. It exists so the AI can explicitly classify a
  non-deductible expense rather than mis-bucketing it. 0% deduction makes intent clear.
