### TSNAP-EPIC-2 — SMS Pipeline
**Owner:** Raj Patel + Sofia Reyes

### TSNAP-EPIC-3 — Substantiation Logic
**Owner:** Priya Sharma + Raj Patel
**Effort:** 10 hours
**Days:** 4-5
**Priority:** P0 (Blocker)

The intelligence that makes TaxSnap different from every other receipt tracker. Implements the IRS decision tree that determines when to ask for receipts, what context to capture, and when documentation is complete.

**Priority:** P0 (Blocker)

The review/management interface. Users come here to see their records, edit details, attach receipts to text-only expenses, and export data. SMS is primary; dashboard is for review.

**Key deliverables:**
- Phone OTP authentication

- Receipt detail page with edit capability
- Substantiation badge display
- CSV export (standard + QuickBooks-compatible)

---

### TSNAP-EPIC-7 — Security (Cross-cutting)
**Owner:** Jordan Kim
**Effort:** 6 hours
**Days:** Throughout
**Priority:** P0 (Blocker)

Security isn't a feature — it's a constraint that affects every other epic. These tickets describe security work that happens IN PARALLEL with other epics.

**Key deliverables:**
- Twilio webhook signature validation
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints
- TCPA opt-in/opt-out compliance
- Session token security
- Photo URL signing
- Input sanitization
- Compliance checklist completion

**See:** `tickets/07-security-crosscutting.md`

---

### TSNAP-EPIC-8 — Email Accountant Feature
**Owner:** Emma Larsson
**Effort:** 4 hours
**Day:** 8 (or slip to week 3)
**Priority:** P1 (Critical — can slip)

Lets users send a monthly summary (PDF + CSV) to their accountant via email. This serves the "I have an accountant" segment without building a full accountant portal.

**Key deliverables:**
- Email service integration (Resend or similar)
- PDF generation of monthly summary
- "Email my accountant" button in dashboard
- Accountant email field in user settings

**This epic can SLIP to week 3 if other work runs over.**

**See:** `tickets/05-landing-legal.md` (bundled at end)

## Critical Path Analysis

**The longest dependency chain:**

```
EPIC 1 (8h) → EPIC 2 (16h) → EPIC 3 (10h) → EPIC 4 (14h) → EPIC 5 (6h) → EPIC 6 (8h)
= 62 hours on critical path
```

**Parallelizable work:**
- EPIC 7 (Security) runs alongside other epics → 6 hours absorbed
- EPIC 8 (Email Accountant) can run during EPIC 4 → 4 hours, can slip

**Realistic timeline:**
- Days 1-2: Foundation (8h)
- Days 3-5: SMS Pipeline + Substantiation in parallel (16h + 10h)
- Days 6-8: Web Dashboard + Email Accountant if time (14h + 4h)
- Day 9: Landing + Legal (6h)
- Day 10: Testing + Launch (8h)

**Total time on critical path: 62 hours.**
**Available time at 5h/day x 10 days: 50 hours.**

**Gap: 12 hours.**

---

## Priya's Recommendations

### Option A: Cut Scope (Recommended)
- Move EPIC 8 (Email Accountant) to week 3 post-launch
- Cut P3 features identified in individual tickets
- Saves: ~6-8 hours
- New total: 64-66 hours

### Option B: Extend Timeline
- Accept that V1 launches Day 12-13 instead of Day 10
- Maintain full scope
- Risk: Burnout, missing content rhythm

### Option C: Both
- Cut to ~60 hours of work
- Plan for Day 11-12 buffer
- Most realistic for solo founder

**Priya votes for Option C.**

## Parallel Execution Notes

While the critical path is sequential, some work CAN happen in parallel:

**During EPIC 2 (SMS Pipeline):**
- Jordan starts EPIC 7 (security work) at the same time
- David can start visual design system that EPIC 4 will use

**During EPIC 3 (Substantiation):**
- This needs to land BEFORE EPIC 4 starts
- But EPIC 2 conversation logic and EPIC 3 substantiation rules can develop together

**During EPIC 4 (Web Dashboard):**
- David finalizes visual components as Emma builds
- Emma can start EPIC 8 in parallel if ahead of schedule
- Jordan continues security work

**During EPIC 5 (Landing):**
- David handles visual design
- Jordan handles legal page content (with lawyer review NOT included in V1 budget — see EPIC 7)

---

## What's NOT in V1

Per CONTEXT.md, the following are explicitly deferred:

- Voice channel (Phase 2)
- Mobile app (Phase 2)
- Tax deadline reminders (Phase 2)
- Stripe billing (free during beta)
- Multi-entity support (Phase 3)
- Plaid bank linking (Phase 3 — V2 feature)
- Full accountant portal (Phase 3 — V3 feature)
- Direct QuickBooks sync (Phase 3)
- State-specific features (Phase 3)
- Tax filing (never)
- Per diem calculations
- International travel rules
- Entertainment expense edge cases
- Complex listed property rules

Do not let scope creep pull these into V1.
